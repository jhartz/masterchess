<h2><img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/jhartz/masterchess/raw/master/resources/Chess-48.png">About</h2>
<p>MasterChess is a simple, cross-platform chess team management system. It includes a Python module for the base management system and a GUI written with wxPython.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>Although MasterChess is cross-platform, the only platform that has up-to-date pre-built binaries is Mac OS X. To download the latest version of MasterChess for Mac, click "Download Mac App" in the header above. (NOTE: The binary available for download was compiled on Snow Leopard; it may or may not work on newer versions of OS X. If you are running in to trouble, try building MasterChess from the source code.)</p>
<p>If you wish to run MasterChess on another platform (Windows, Linux, etc.), you will have to install the prerequisites and build MasterChess from the source code. (See the "Development" section below.)</p>
